Francesca McDonagh, Bank of Ireland CEO, says: For many years, the trend to digital banking has been evident, with customers using branches less and less.

The report outlines the milestones required for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C as per the 2015 Paris Agreement in the areas of energy, cities and other human settlements, industry, land use, oceans and coastal zones, transport, water and resilience.  In turn, this will provide a blueprint to coordinate climate ambition among cities, regions, businesses and investors in the run up to the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November 2021.  With a view that the restoration of nature at scale is crucial for the success of the goals highlighted in the Paris Agreement, emerging fintech Cultivo plans to deploy $1 billion into restoring at least 3.5 million hectares of land within the next five years, calling upon investors to utilise nature to protect biodiversity and capture CO2.  Dr Manuel Pinuela, co-founder and CEO of Cultivo, highlights how \u201cnature-based solutions can provide at least 30% of the CO2 mitigation goals by 2030, yet receive only around 3% of the funding allocated to carbon capture.\u201d  As a result, the fintech firm is on a mission to fill this \u201cfinancing gap\u201d, pushing the importance of natural restoration, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity protection.  Cultivo does this with \u201can innovative financing mechanism that connects financial institutions to NGOs and landowners in order to unlock investment into natural capital opportunities that restore nature, protect livelihoods, and deliver healthy financial returns to investors.\u201d  The fintech uses proprietary algorithms and remote sensor technologies to identify high quality projects and forecast the natural capital returns, pooling investment products and providing financial institutions with a simple way to invest in sustainable projects, such as regenerative grazing or planting trees.  These generate carbon credits and other offsets that can be sold, providing a return to investors and a long-term reliable income stream to the landowners and local communities. One successful example involves startup TerViva.  Cultivo helps farmers finance the growth of pongamia, a 1000-year plant protein, which has similar properties to soy, but is a less intensive crop for the soil. The proven sustainability benefits of pongamia can then be translated into carbon credits \u2013 this in turn creates a new revenue stream for the farmers.  Dr Pinuela says that \u201cwhile the pipeline of nature-based solutions is large, one of the painpoints that institutions and corporations have is that it is difficult to find high quality projects.\u201d  Defining what he means by high quality, he continues to say that natural capital should create a flow of ecosystem services, or \u201cthe ability to capture carbon and maintain biodiversity.\u201d A distressed asset like a degraded forest, grassland or wetland must be considered, as the tonnes of CO2 captured, number of species protected, or amount of water captured could be substantial.  Therefore, fintech startups like Cultivo work with NGOs to connect financial institutions and landowners so that they understand whether their land can be restored using data. In the same way that all businesses now have a corporate responsibility to fight climate change consistent with the Paris Accord, there is no excuse for financial institutions not utilising sustainable data.  Dr Pinuela takes this one step further and states that while there is no excuse when considering the abundance and granularity of data available, humans are also on a tight deadline to restore the planet.  Alongside this, incremental changes such as planting trees are being made, but as Dr Pinuela explains, other landscapes need to be considered in line with the economic impact on rural communities.

The report outlines the milestones required for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C as per the 2015 Paris Agreement in the areas of energy, cities and other human settlements, industry, land use, oceans and coastal zones, transport, water and resilience.  In turn, this will provide a blueprint to coordinate climate ambition among cities, regions, businesses and investors in the run up to the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November 2021.  With a view that the restoration of nature at scale is crucial for the success of the goals highlighted in the Paris Agreement, emerging fintech Cultivo plans to deploy $1 billion into restoring at least 3.5 million hectares of land within the next five years, calling upon investors to utilise nature to protect biodiversity and capture CO2.  Dr Manuel Pinuela, co-founder and CEO of Cultivo, highlights how \u201cnature-based solutions can provide at least 30% of the CO2 mitigation goals by 2030, yet receive only around 3% of the funding allocated to carbon capture.\u201d  As a result, the fintech firm is on a mission to fill this \u201cfinancing gap\u201d, pushing the importance of natural restoration, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity protection.  Cultivo does this with \u201can innovative financing mechanism that connects financial institutions to NGOs and landowners in order to unlock investment into natural capital opportunities that restore nature, protect livelihoods, and deliver healthy financial returns to investors.\u201d  The fintech uses proprietary algorithms and remote sensor technologies to identify high quality projects and forecast the natural capital returns, pooling investment products and providing financial institutions with a simple way to invest in sustainable projects, such as regenerative grazing or planting trees.  These generate carbon credits and other offsets that can be sold, providing a return to investors and a long-term reliable income stream to the landowners and local communities. One successful example involves startup TerViva.  Cultivo helps farmers finance the growth of pongamia, a 1000-year plant protein, which has similar properties to soy, but is a less intensive crop for the soil. The proven sustainability benefits of pongamia can then be translated into carbon credits \u2013 this in turn creates a new revenue stream for the farmers.  Dr Pinuela says that \u201cwhile the pipeline of nature-based solutions is large, one of the painpoints that institutions and corporations have is that it is difficult to find high quality projects.\u201d  Defining what he means by high quality, he continues to say that natural capital should create a flow of ecosystem services, or \u201cthe ability to capture carbon and maintain biodiversity.\u201d A distressed asset like a degraded forest, grassland or wetland must be considered, as the tonnes of CO2 captured, number of species protected, or amount of water captured could be substantial.  Therefore, fintech startups like Cultivo work with NGOs to connect financial institutions and landowners so that they understand whether their land can be restored using data. In the same way that all businesses now have a corporate responsibility to fight climate change consistent with the Paris Accord, there is no excuse for financial institutions not utilising sustainable data.  Dr Pinuela takes this one step further and states that while there is no excuse when considering the abundance and granularity of data available, humans are also on a tight deadline to restore the planet.  Alongside this, incremental changes such as planting trees are being made, but as Dr Pinuela explains, other landscapes need to be considered in line with the economic impact on rural communities.

The report outlines the milestones required for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C as per the 2015 Paris Agreement in the areas of energy, cities and other human settlements, industry, land use, oceans and coastal zones, transport, water and resilience.  In turn, this will provide a blueprint to coordinate climate ambition among cities, regions, businesses and investors in the run up to the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November 2021.  With a view that the restoration of nature at scale is crucial for the success of the goals highlighted in the Paris Agreement, emerging fintech Cultivo plans to deploy $1 billion into restoring at least 3.5 million hectares of land within the next five years, calling upon investors to utilise nature to protect biodiversity and capture CO2.  Dr Manuel Pinuela, co-founder and CEO of Cultivo, highlights how \u201cnature-based solutions can provide at least 30% of the CO2 mitigation goals by 2030, yet receive only around 3% of the funding allocated to carbon capture.\u201d  As a result, the fintech firm is on a mission to fill this \u201cfinancing gap\u201d, pushing the importance of natural restoration, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity protection.  Cultivo does this with \u201can innovative financing mechanism that connects financial institutions to NGOs and landowners in order to unlock investment into natural capital opportunities that restore nature, protect livelihoods, and deliver healthy financial returns to investors.\u201d  The fintech uses proprietary algorithms and remote sensor technologies to identify high quality projects and forecast the natural capital returns, pooling investment products and providing financial institutions with a simple way to invest in sustainable projects, such as regenerative grazing or planting trees.  These generate carbon credits and other offsets that can be sold, providing a return to investors and a long-term reliable income stream to the landowners and local communities. One successful example involves startup TerViva.  Cultivo and TerViva are helping farmers finance the cultivation of pongamia, a tree crop used for thousands of years in Asian cultures. Pongamia produces oilseeds that have similar properties to soy and requires fewer chemical inputs, fixes nitrogen to regenerate soils, and sequesters carbon in the form of woody biomass. The proven sustainability benefits of pongamia can then be translated into carbon credits \u2013 this in turn creates a new revenue stream for the farmers.  Dr Pinuela says that \u201cwhile the pipeline of nature-based solutions is large, one of the painpoints that institutions and corporations have is that it is difficult to find high quality projects.\u201d  Defining what he means by high quality, he continues to say that natural capital should create a flow of ecosystem services, or \u201cthe ability to capture carbon and maintain biodiversity.\u201d A distressed asset like a degraded forest, grassland or wetland must be considered, as the tonnes of CO2 captured, number of species protected, or amount of water captured could be substantial.  Therefore, fintech startups like Cultivo work with NGOs to connect financial institutions and landowners so that they understand whether their land can be restored using data. In the same way that all businesses now have a corporate responsibility to fight climate change consistent with the Paris Accord, there is no excuse for financial institutions not utilising sustainable data.  Dr Pinuela takes this one step further and states that while there is no excuse when considering the abundance and granularity of data available, humans are also on a tight deadline to restore the planet.  Alongside this, incremental changes such as planting trees are being made, but as Dr Pinuela explains, other landscapes need to be considered in line with the economic impact on rural communities.

The report outlines the milestones required for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C as per the 2015 Paris Agreement in the areas of energy, cities and other human settlements, industry, land use, oceans and coastal zones, transport, water and resilience.  In turn, this will provide a blueprint to coordinate climate ambition among cities, regions, businesses and investors in the run up to the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November 2021.  With a view that the restoration of nature at scale is crucial for the success of the goals highlighted in the Paris Agreement, emerging fintech Cultivo plans to deploy $1 billion into restoring at least 3.5 million hectares of land within the next five years, calling upon investors to utilise nature to protect biodiversity and capture CO2.  Dr Manuel Pinuela, co-founder and CEO of Cultivo, highlights how \u201cnature-based solutions can provide at least 30% of the CO2 mitigation goals by 2030, yet receive only around 3% of the funding allocated to carbon capture.\u201d  As a result, the fintech firm is on a mission to fill this \u201cfinancing gap\u201d, pushing the importance of natural restoration, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity protection.  Cultivo does this with \u201can innovative financing mechanism that connects financial institutions to NGOs and landowners in order to unlock investment into natural capital opportunities that restore nature, protect livelihoods, and deliver healthy financial returns to investors.\u201d  The fintech uses proprietary algorithms and remote sensor technologies to identify high quality projects and forecast the natural capital returns, pooling investment products and providing financial institutions with a simple way to invest in sustainable projects, such as regenerative grazing or planting trees.  These generate carbon credits and other offsets that can be sold, providing a return to investors and a long-term reliable income stream to the landowners and local communities. One successful example involves startup TerViva.  Cultivo and TerViva are helping farmers finance the cultivation of pongamia, a tree crop used for thousands of years in Asian cultures. Pongamia produces oilseeds that have similar properties to soy and requires fewer chemical inputs, fixes nitrogen to regenerate soils, and sequesters carbon in the form of woody biomass. The proven sustainability benefits of pongamia can then be translated into carbon credits \u2013 this in turn creates a new revenue stream for the farmers.  Dr Pinuela says that \u201cwhile the pipeline of nature-based solutions is large, one of the painpoints that institutions and corporations have is that it is difficult to find high quality projects.\u201d  Defining what he means by high quality, he continues to say that natural capital should create a flow of ecosystem services, or \u201cthe ability to capture carbon and maintain biodiversity.\u201d A distressed asset like a degraded forest, grassland or wetland must be considered, as the tonnes of CO2 captured, number of species protected, or amount of water captured could be substantial.  Therefore, fintech startups like Cultivo work with NGOs to connect financial institutions and landowners so that they understand whether their land can be restored using data. In the same way that all businesses now have a corporate responsibility to fight climate change consistent with the Paris Accord, there is no excuse for financial institutions not utilising sustainable data.  Dr Pinuela takes this one step further and states that while there is no excuse when considering the abundance and granularity of data available, humans are also on a tight deadline to restore the planet.  Alongside this, incremental changes such as planting trees are being made, but as Dr Pinuela explains, other landscapes need to be considered in line with the economic impact on rural communities.

The report outlines the milestones required for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C as per the 2015 Paris Agreement in the areas of energy, cities and other human settlements, industry, land use, oceans and coastal zones, transport, water and resilience.  In turn, this will provide a blueprint to coordinate climate ambition among cities, regions, businesses and investors in the run up to the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November 2021.  With a view that the restoration of nature at scale is crucial for the success of the goals highlighted in the Paris Agreement, emerging fintech Cultivo plans to deploy $1 billion into restoring at least 3.5 million hectares of land within the next five years, calling upon investors to utilise nature to protect biodiversity and capture CO2.  Dr Manuel Pinuela, co-founder and CEO of Cultivo, highlights how \u201cnature-based solutions can provide at least 30% of the CO2 mitigation goals by 2030, yet receive only around 3% of the funding allocated to carbon capture.\u201d  As a result, the fintech firm is on a mission to fill this \u201cfinancing gap\u201d, pushing the importance of natural restoration, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity protection.  Cultivo does this with \u201can innovative financing mechanism that connects financial institutions to NGOs and landowners in order to unlock investment into natural capital opportunities that restore nature, protect livelihoods, and deliver healthy financial returns to investors.\u201d  The fintech uses proprietary algorithms and remote sensor technologies to identify high quality projects and forecast the natural capital returns, pooling investment products and providing financial institutions with a simple way to invest in sustainable projects, such as regenerative grazing or planting trees.  These generate carbon credits and other offsets that can be sold, providing a return to investors and a long-term reliable income stream to the landowners and local communities. One successful example involves startup TerViva.  Cultivo and TerViva are helping farmers finance the cultivation of pongamia, a tree crop used for thousands of years in Asian cultures. Pongamia produces oilseeds that have similar properties to soy and requires fewer chemical inputs, fixes nitrogen to regenerate soils, and sequesters carbon in the form of woody biomass. The proven sustainability benefits of pongamia can then be translated into carbon credits \u2013 this in turn creates a new revenue stream for the farmers.  Dr Pinuela says that \u201cwhile the pipeline of nature-based solutions is large, one of the painpoints that institutions and corporations have is that it is difficult to find high quality projects.\u201d  Defining what he means by high quality, he continues to say that natural capital should create a flow of ecosystem services, or \u201cthe ability to capture carbon and maintain biodiversity.\u201d A distressed asset like a degraded forest, grassland or wetland must be considered, as the tonnes of CO2 captured, number of species protected, or amount of water captured could be substantial.  Therefore, fintech startups like Cultivo work with NGOs to connect financial institutions and landowners so that they understand whether their land can be restored using data. In the same way that all businesses now have a corporate responsibility to fight climate change consistent with the Paris Accord, there is no excuse for financial institutions not utilising sustainable data.  Dr Pinuela takes this one step further and states that while there is no excuse when considering the abundance and granularity of data available, humans are also on a tight deadline to restore the planet.  Alongside this, incremental changes such as planting trees are being made, but as Dr Pinuela explains, other landscapes need to be considered in line with the economic impact on rural communities.

Covid-19 has accelerated this changing behaviour, and we\u2019ve seen a seismic shift towards digital banking over the past 12 months. We\u2019ve now reached a tipping point in customer preferences between online and offline banking.\" She says 70% of customers are now digitally active, with a 26% increase in customers registering for the new mobile app since launch. The branch closure programme comes as part of a new three-year strategy to trim costs by \u20ac1.5 billion, entailing a reduction in 1400 full time roles achieved through voluntary redundancies. Up to 200 jobs will be impacted by the branch takedowns, which will mostly hit umanned outlets.", "source": "Finextra"},

The startup is building on the strong sense of kinship shared by the Catalonian community, which erupted five years ago in a struggle to secure independence from Spain. Jordi Roset, co-owner of the Petrolis Independents fuel chain, explains his decision to become a founding shareholder: \"I am not investing in the bank like those shareholders who are all day looking at the stock market to see if they made a killing; for me it\u2019s an investment for the future and the country. \u201cMoreover, as a Catalonian I would like to say that we saw many large banks with a long history here, decamp after the independence referendum in 2017. This really shocked all of us. To have a community bank like 11Onze, of which we are founding shareholders, gives me the confidence that it\u2019s here for us and it will stay here for us, for our society and its business fabric.\u201d 11Onze founder James S\u00e8ne says being digital will not compromise its ambition to offer a personal service. \u201cWhen banks became digitised, they inevitably became distanced from their customers. Customers are often served by bots or strangers on the end of a phone line. 11Onze brings the local bank experience into a digital world,\" he says. \"Every customer will be connected to a dedicated 11Onze member whom they know by name and background. It\u2019s not merely about going digital, it\u2019s also about keeping it local and intimate.\u201d", "source": "Finextra"}
